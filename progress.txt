kroz_test.py progress
NOTE: this can be converted into a markdown (.md) file, I am just not comfortable with the format as of now.

Current features:

- Game window (remains open until closed by player)
- Player icon (yellow circle)
- Movable player

Features to add soon:

- Diagonal movement (In actual Kroz game, diagonal movements are binded to separate keys)
- Collecting gems (at this point it can just be another shape of a different color)
- Gem and score tracking (10 points for collecting one gem)


Bugs:

- In lines 59 and 63 (in Game Loop section), there is a conditional to prevent player from moving off the 
screen, but it currently doesn't work


Features to add in the future:

- "Creatures" that attack the player
- Breakable and unbreakable walls
- Text message that describes objects like gems and walls

kroz_level.py progress

Current features:

- Left and right click mouse detection and coordinates
- Grid view function to easily visualize chunks
- Creating walls and other shapes with left click
- Undoing previous creations with right click (unless there is nothing on screen)
- The wall is drawn in real-time and moves with the cursor

Features to add soon:

- Created objects (like walls) should snap to the nearest grid chunk
- The list variable that stores the objects should transfer over to kroz_test.py and be playable
- Multiple objects should not be able to be created in the same grid chunk
- Cursor should not be able to go off screen and select a negative coordinate
