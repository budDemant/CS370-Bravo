kroz_test.py progress

Current features:

- Game window (remains open until closed by player)
- Player icon (yellow circle)
- Movable player
- Walls
- Collision detection between objects (like player and enemy)
- Collision detection between player and walls

Features to add:

- Diagonal movement (In actual Kroz game, diagonal movements are binded to separate keys)
- Collecting gems (at this point it can just be another shape of a different color)
- Gem and score tracking (10 points for collecting one gem)
- "Creatures" that attack the player
- Breakable and unbreakable walls
- Text message that describes objects like gems and walls


Bugs:
    FIXED:
    - In lines 59 and 63 (in Game Loop section), there is a conditional to prevent player from moving off the 
    screen, but it currently doesn't work
    - the player clipping into the wall and not being able to move.
    - importing variables from kroz_level.py results in executing only kroz_level.py

    WIP:
    - list of placed walls from kroz_level.py is not importing correctly




kroz_level.py progress

Current features:

- Left and right click mouse detection and coordinates
- Grid view function to easily visualize chunks
- Creating walls and other shapes with left click
- Undoing previous creations with right click (unless there is nothing on screen)
- The wall is drawn in real-time and moves with the cursor
- Created objects (like walls) snap to the nearest grid chunk
- Grid drawing is modular, so only 3 variables need to be edited

Features to add:

- The list variable that stores the objects should transfer over to kroz_test.py and be playable

Bugs:
    FIXED:
    - Cursor can go outside of grid and select negative coordinates
    - If nothing is drawn on the screen, and rmb is selected, the program crashes
    
    - 

    WIP:
    - Multiple objects should not be able to be created in the same grid chunk
    - the drawn circle for the player is not centered
