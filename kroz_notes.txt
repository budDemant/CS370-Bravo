What I've learned about the game through playing:

Instructions describe basic game mechanics, including what each icon ("object") means

"Creatures" run into you and take gems from you
If you have no gems, you die

You can use Whips to kill creatures or smash through "breakable walls"
Whips can be found (they look like canes) around the levels or in chests ("C")

when you touch a new object, a message appears at the bottom of the screen that
describes it

slow, medium, and fast speed monsters (speed determines dmg / how many gems they take from you)

You can save the game with space, then A, B, or C

There is a UI on the right, showing your Score, Level #, Gems, Whips, etc.

You can lead creatures into breakable walls and they will die

You lose Score by bumping into breakable walls

The creatures seem to bunch together, and they move laterally

Going down the stairs leads to a room full of monsters, it was chaotic
